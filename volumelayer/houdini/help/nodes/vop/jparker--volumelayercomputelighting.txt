"""Add a component property to an input VolumeLayer struct."""

== Overview ==

This operator takes a VolumeLayer struct as input and converts it to material outputs and standard Houdini AOVs.

This relies on the built-in [Compute Lighting|computelighting] node.  Because the implementation of that node is not guaranteed by Side Effects to be stable, the internal outputs of this node may also change between Houdini versions.
