"""Add a component property to an input VolumeLayer struct."""

== Overview ==

This operator takes a VolumeLayer struct as input and adds scattering, absorption and emission to it. 

@inputs
volumelayer:
    VolumeLayer to modify

@parameters

Scattering:
    #id: scatter

    Scattering amount.  How much light is scattered by the material per-unit distance.

Absorption:
    #id: absorb

    Absorption amount.  How much light is absorbed by the material per-unit distance.

Emission:
    #id: emit

    Emission amount.  How much light is emitted by the material per-unit distance.
