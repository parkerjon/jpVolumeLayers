= Transmission to Absorption =

""" Converts volume transmission color to absorption coefficient."""

@inputs

transmit:
    Transmission color.  This is what absorption looks like visually when scattering is white.  When converted to absorption, the value is non-linear: black values become near infinite absorption probabilities.

@outputs

absorb:
    Volume absorption coefficient.
