""" Adjusts volume layer properties in indirect bounces. """

== Overview ==

This operator takes a VolumeLayer struct as input and modifies extinction and BSDF albedo in indirect bounces.  Lowering the extinction and increasing the albedo can add more softness to volume lighting without increasing render time, as opposed to increasing the number of indirect bounces.

@inputs
volumelayer:
    VolumeLayer to modify

@parameters

Contribution Modifier:
    #id: contributionmodifier

    Multiply BSDF albedo by this amount for every indirect ray bounce.

Extinction Modifier:
    #id: extinctionmodifier

    Multiply apparent extinction (density) by this amount for every indirect ray bounce.

Modifier Start Level:
    #id: modifierstartlevel

    Minimum indirect bounce level to apply the contribution and extinction modifiers at.  Zero means the first indirect bounce onwards is affected.
