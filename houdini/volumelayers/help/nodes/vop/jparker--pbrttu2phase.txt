""" Generates a scattering phase function BSDF that simulates interstellar dust scattering."""

== Overview ==

This operator implements the two-term ultraspherical phase function, which approximates scattering by dust grains in the interstellar medium.

TIP:
    To apply physically meaningful values to the parameters, start by selecting one of the presets in the "bandpreset" parameter.


@parameters

Component Label:
    #id: label
    BSDF component label.
    
Band Preset:
    #id: bandpreset
    Applies a preset for a specific electromagnetic frequency.

Forward Phase:
    #id: g1
    Forward scattering phase.  Larger values scatter more strongly forward.

Backward Phase:
    #id: g2
    Backscattering phase.  Lower values scatter more strongly back towards the viewer.

Weight:
    #id: y
    How much to weight towards the forward or backward phase.  A value of 1 weights the forward phase by 100%.

@outputs

f:
    BSDF
