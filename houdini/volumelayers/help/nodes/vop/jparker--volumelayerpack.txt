"""Combine standard Houdini VEX shader inputs and create a VolumeLayer struct output."""

@inputs
F:
    BSDF component input

extinction:
    Total extinction (density) input.  You need to ensure that the BSDF input already has the correct albedo computed relative to the extinction, which is a sum of scattering+absorption.  This value should be the unitless value before dPdZ is applied.

Ce:
    Emission coefficient.  This is the unitless value before dPdz is applied.
