= Volume Layer Mix =

"""Mix two volume layers."""

== Overview ==

This operator takes two VolumeLayer struct-based VOP nodes and mixes them together in a physically correct way.

TIP:
    The "VolumeLayerMix" VEX function has more options for combining two VolumeLayer structs with individual weights for F, density and Ce.

@inputs
A:
    VolumeLayer struct A

B:
    VolumeLayer struct B

mix:
    Blend value to mix the two inputs.
