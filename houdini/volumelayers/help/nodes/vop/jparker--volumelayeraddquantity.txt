"""Add a component property to an input VolumeLayer struct."""

== Overview ==

This operator takes a VolumeLayer struct as input and adds scattering, absorption or emission to it. 

@inputs
volumelayer:
    VolumeLayer to modify

@parameters

Scattering:
    #id: scatter

    Scattering coefficient.  Probability light is scattered by the material, ranging from zero to infinity.

Absorption:
    #id: absorb

    Absorption coefficient.  Probability light is absorbed by the material, ranging from zero to infinity.

Emission:
    #id: emit

    Emission coefficient.  Probability light is re-emitted by the material, ranging from zero to infinity.
