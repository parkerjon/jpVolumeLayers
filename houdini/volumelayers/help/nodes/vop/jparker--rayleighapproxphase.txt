= PBR Approximated Rayleigh Phase Function =

""" Generates a phase function that approximates the Rayleigh scattering distribution."""

== Overview ==

This operator combines two Henyey-Greenstein phase functions to roughly approximate the Rayleigh phase function. This is the most common phase function used to simulate the scattering of light in the Earth's atmosphere.
